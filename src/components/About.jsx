                    MontyHacks is the annual hackathon of Montgomery High School, located in Skillman, New Jersey — 2022 marks the fifth year we’ve been running it. MontyHacks V will be run fully in-person at Montgomery High School.
                    <br/> <br/>Participants will collaborate with each other to build cool projects and compete for over $1,000 in prizes! Throughout the day, we’ll have workshops and talks as well as free food and SWAG (shirts, stickers, etc.). 
                    <br/> <br/>Beginner and veteran programmers alike will have a great time at MontyHacks while also learning new skills and technologies in a team environment. We hope to see you there!
